# 🖥️ PC Controller Presentation

A simple Python-based app that turns your PC into a **remote controller server**. It lets you control your computer from any device on the same network using a web interface — ideal for **presentations**, **media control**, or **remote input**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 WebSocket server to receive remote button presses (like arrow keys)
- 🌐 Flask server to serve a lightweight HTML controller interface
- 📱 QR Code display to instantly access the controller from your phone
- 💡 Simple and clean GUI using Tkinter
- 🧠 Automatically installs required libraries if missing
- 🖱️ Supports basic key press actions via buttons

## 📦 Requirements

This script will auto-install any missing libraries, but here’s what it uses:

- Python 3.7+
- `pyautogui`, `websockets`, `flask`, `qrcode`, `Pillow`, `tkinter`, `ip_lib`

Make sure your environment allows installing packages via `pip`.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The script launches:
   - A **Flask web server** on port `1625` (to serve the web UI)
   - A **WebSocket server** on port `1626` (to receive button commands)
   - A **Tkinter GUI window** that displays the local URL and a QR Code for easy access

2. From any device on the **same Wi-Fi network**, scan the QR code or open the displayed URL.

3. Press buttons on the webpage, and it will send key press commands to your PC in real-time.

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python pc_controller.py
   ```

2. **Wait for the GUI** to appear. It will show the local IP address and a QR code.

3. **Scan the QR code** with your phone or open the URL in any browser.

4. **Start controlling** your PC remotely!

## 🟢 Use Cases (Positive Points)

- 🎤 **Presentation Mode**: Control slides without touching your PC
- 🎬 **Media Control**: Play/pause or skip content from your bed or couch
- 🤹‍♂️ **Cross-Device Control**: Use your phone or tablet as a wireless remote
- ⚙️ **Offline Friendly**: Runs locally with no need for internet
- 🧩 **Extensible**: Add more features (mouse control, volume, etc.) easily

## ❗ Notes

- Make sure both devices (PC & phone) are connected to the **same local network**.
- The WebSocket handler currently supports simple key presses (e.g., arrows, spacebar, etc.).
- The static HTML controller can be customized in `static/index.html`.

## 🔒 Security Warning

This app does **not include authentication** by default. Anyone on your network could connect if they know the IP and port. Add security layers if needed for public use.
